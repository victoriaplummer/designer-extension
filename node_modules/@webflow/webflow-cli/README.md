# Webflow CLI

## Install

```shell
npm i @webflow/webflow-cli
```

## Usage


### DevLink
```shell
npx webflow devlink -h
```

In order to use the DevLink CLI first you'll need to create a `.webflowrc` configuration file on your application's root directory. 
The supported formats are JavaScript(.js) and JSON (.json). 

It should look something like this:

JSON:
```json
{
  "host": "https://api.wfdev.io:8443",
  "rootDir": "./devlink",
  "siteId": "[YOUR SITE ID]",
  "authToken": "[API TOKEN]"
}
```

JavaScript:
```js
module.exports = {
  host: "https://api.wfdev.io:8443",
  rootDir: "./devlink",
  siteId: "[YOUR SITE ID]",
  authToken: process.env.WF_TOKEN,
};
```

You'll have to generate an API token to your application. This can be done on your Webflow project
by going to Site Settings > Integrations.

#### Sync your design system

```shell
npx webflow devlink sync
```
